# Meta-regression of genome-wide association studies to estimate age-varying geneetic effects

This page contains all the materials necessary to run the analyses presented in: 
*Pagoni P, Higgins JPT, Lawlor DA, Stergiakouli E, Warrington NM, Morris TT & Tilling K. 
Meta-regression of genome-wide association studies to estimate age-varying genetic effects. 
Accepted in European Journal of Epidemiology.*

**Description of scripts:**

•	Stata do file “Simulate_studies.do” can be used to simulate individual level data of studies across all simulated age overlaps. 

•	R script “Simulate_metan_metareg.R” can be used to apply fixed-effect & random-effects meta-analysis and random-effects meta-regression across all age-overlaps.

•	R script “Performance_measures.R” can be used to calculate performance measures across all age-overlaps. 

Analysts can choose to vary the parameters used in the manuscript to assess the performance of meta-analysis and meta-regression under differing scenarios.

For any questions, please contact Panagiota Pagoni: panagiota.pagoni@bristol.ac.uk.
